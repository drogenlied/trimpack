.SH NAME
trimpack \- utilities for Trimble Trimpack GPS receivers
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B trimpack
is a set of utilities for the Trimble Trimpack GPS receivers.

.B trimpack
utilities communicate with a Trimble Trimpack GPS receiver using its
binary communication protocol. Military-surplus Trimpack GPS receivers
include an RS-422 data port which normally operates at 9600 baud, 8
data bits, odd parity, one stop bit. Later models may be configured to
output NMEA-0183, but
.B trimpack
utilities only understand the binary output format.
