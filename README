INTRODUCTION

    trimpack is a set of utilities for military surplus Trimble
    Trimpack GPS receivers. These utilities communicate with a Trimble
    Trimpack GPS receiver using its binary communication protocol.
    Military-surplus Trimpack GPS receivers include an RS-422 data
    port which normally operates at 9600 baud, 8 data bits, odd
    parity, one stop bit. Later models may be configured to output
    NMEA-0183, but trimpack utilities only understand the binary
    output format.

    This software is based upon the data interface specification in
    this manual, which the author purchased as a printed copy from
    Trimble many years ago:

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    You will need appropriate hardware to connect a Trimpack to your
    computer. The trimpack utilities expect to use a standard serial
    port on your computer. It is possible to connect a Trimpack to an
    ordinary RS-232 port, even though the Trimpack uses RS-422
    electrical signalling. Here is the pinout of the I/O connector on
    a military Trimpack:

    Pin	    Name	Direction	Description
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     A	    RXD(-)	Input		Receive Data -
     B	    TXD(-)	Output		Transmit Data -
     C	    TXD(+)	Output		Transmit Data +
     D	    RXD(+)	Input		Receive Data +
     E	    HQ/PPS	Output		Pulse-Per-Second or HAVE QUICK
     F	    GND				Signal Ground
